However, when the user starts scrolling the grid\n   * in a direction, we want to render as many cells as possible in that direction, as to avoid presenting white\n   * areas if the user scrolls too fast/far and the viewport ends up in a region we haven't rendered yet. To render\n   * more cells, we store some offsets to add to the viewport in `scrollCache.buffer`. Those offsets make the render\n   * context wider in the direction the user is going, but also makes the buffer around the viewport `0` for the\n   * dimension (horizontal or vertical) in which the user is not scrolling. So if the normal viewport is 8 columns\n   * wide, with a 1 column buffer (10 columns total), then we want it to be exactly 8 columns wide during vertical\n   * scroll.\n   * However, we don't want the rows in the old context to re-render from e.g. 10 columns to 8 columns, because that's\n   * work that's not necessary. Thus we store the context at the start of the scroll in `frozenContext`, and the rows\n   * that are part of this old context will keep their same render context as to avoid re-rendering.\n   */\n  const scrollPosition = React.useRef(initialState?.scroll ??

applied by the filtering plugin if the row grouping is the current way of grouping rows,\n * but not if the tree data is the current way of grouping rows.\n *\n * =====================================================================================================================\n *\n * The plugin containing the custom logic must use:\n *\n * - `useGridRegisterStrategyProcessor` to register their processor.\n *   When the processor of the active strategy changes, it will fire `\"activeStrategyProcessorChange\"` to re-apply the processor.\n

to update something when the active strategy changes.\n *    Warning: Be careful not to apply the processor several times.\n *    For instance \"rowsSet\" is fired by `useGridRows` whenever the active
